	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
	<p class="intro">My name is Michael Richey and I am taking Development with HTML and CSS. This class is a class that is offered by Bellevue University. I am taking this class to get my batchelors degree.</p>	
	<p>I was born in a town called Aurora, Colorado. <span class="sentence">When I was seven years old I moved to a town called North Platte, Nebraska.</span> I do not remember much from my time in Aurora, Colorado.</p>
	<p>I currently work at the public library of the town I live in. I work there as the full time technology assistant. I also get to work in the makerspace, teaching people how to use equipment such as a 3d printer and a laser cutter.</p>
	<p>In my free time I like to draw, read and play video games. My favorite video game is a game called Monster Hunter. I also really enjoy learning new skills, such as programming and different art mediums.</p>
